# CSSFrameworksWeek2

Basic Requirements
To successfully complete this assignment, fulfill the following goals:

- Use a "main.scss" (or equiv.) file and proper "@import" statements to add stylesheets. - ✓
- Use proper hierarchy. - ✓
- Add color definitions and/or other constant values for customization using variables. - ✓
- Add at least one mixin to handle a common repetitive style definition (experimental features, branded styles, themes, etc.). - ✓

Stretch Goals
If you prefer an additional challenge, attempt the following goals:

- Create a theme structure: Add a class to the body element of your document, then use hierarchy, variables, and mixins to allow you to change the look of the whole page by changing the class on the body element. (Extra stretch: Create a little JS connected to a select element to allow the user to conveniently switch between themes.)
- Make an animation mixin: Make a mixin that you can use to animate any other style you wish.
